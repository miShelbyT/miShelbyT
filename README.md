### Hello World! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> 🥰
My name is Shelby Talbert. I'm a full stack software engineer, graduate of NYC's Flatiron School. I admit, I love the front-end work the most. Completely obsessed with JavaScript, React, Redux. But also darn good at modeling and Rails as a b/e API.

I am published in Medium's [Level Up Coding](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/), [Noteworthy](https://blog.usejournal.com/), [An Idea](https://medium.com/an-idea) and [Nerd For Tech](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech) publications.
