### Hello World! 🥰 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Shelby Talbert. I'm a full stack software engineer, graduate of NYC's Flatiron School. I admit, I love the front-end work the most. Completely obsessed with JavaScript, React, Redux. But also darn good at modeling and Rails as a b/e API.
