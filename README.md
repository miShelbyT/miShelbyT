My name is Shelby Talbert. I'm a full stack web developer and graduate of the Flatiron School, and was an instructor at the Flatiron School for a little over one year. ðŸ¥° I *just* completed my BS in Software Engineering at Western Governor's University. What can I say, I'm addicted to learning! ðŸ¤“
